## Podman

Podman is a container runtime tool that allows you to manage and run containers on your system. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing containers, images, and container networks.

With Podman, you can:

- Create and manage containers: Podman can, start, stop, and delete containers.

- Build and manage container images: Podman provides commands to build container images from Dockerfiles or existing containers. You can also push and pull images from container registries.

- Manage container networks: Podman allows you to create and manage container networks, enabling containers to communicate with each other and with the host system.

- Secure container operations: Podman provides features to ensure the security of container operations, such as running containers as non-root users and isolating containers from the host system.

Podman is a lightweight alternative to Docker and can be used as a drop-in replacement for Docker in many cases. It is particularly useful in environments where running Docker as a daemon is not desirable or allowed.
